# Razor-mock

Simple proof-of-concept to see whether we can produce razor templates for Umbraco without actually running umbraco.

It pulls in `model.json` and `template.razor` (probably not the correct suffix) and renders the resulting markup into `index.html`.

## Installation

None, dependencies loaded via CDN, requires no additional package installation.

## Usage

Run `index.html` from localhost, or use [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) or use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` if you have Python on your system.
